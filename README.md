I built a website for fantasy sports that offers tools to give you an edge during your fantasy draft, along with other helpful in-season features. Best of all, it’s completely free to use and doesn’t require any sign-up. It supports Sleeper, Yahoo and Espn league.

Imagine being able to use your own custom ADP draft ranking list during your fantasy draft, right alongside the default one provided by your platform. What if you could also incorporate multiple cheat sheets from other sources like BeerSheets, tier list from Fantasy Pros, rankings from your favorite podcast, rookie rankings, sleepers, and more—directly into your live draft?

The challenge is that, while you can easily obtain or create these lists, managing them during a live draft is nearly impossible, especially when it comes to keeping track of players who have already been picked. That's where my website's draft tool comes in.

My tool automatically crosses out drafted players from any draft ranking or cheat sheet site in real time. With just a click, you can mark off all players who have been drafted, making it easier to view your remaining options and decide on your next pick. You can do this across as many sites as you want, regardless of the player list format. As long as the player’s full first and last name appears on the site, my tool will cross it out, even from articles and paragraphs.

You can also integrate this functionality with Google Sheets. My website can connect to your Google Spreadsheet account, allowing you to use your customized cheat sheets and draft ranking. You can create as many sheets as you like, or just copy & paste a draft ranking list from a site like Fantasy pros and modify it to your liking. As long as the player’s full name is in a cell, my tool will cross it out, even if there are additional words or characters in the cell. Pic of google sheet in action: https://imgur.com/xc2rcho

This tool lets you take advantage of ADP discrepancies between platforms, fully customize your draft rankings, and manage multiple cheat sheets. Take control of your draft with your own personalized strategy—my tool makes it easy and efficient!

You can use the chrome extension to cross out players or use a button on my website.

It has other tools such as Waiver Wire assist to help with your waiver wire when you are doing your research on sites. An AI-powered tool (integrated with ChatGPT) that gives you weekly advice on who to start or sit. 

I will update this post with more description on these in-season tools when the season starts. Save this post.
